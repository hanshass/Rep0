This project is called the iPwn toolkit

Quick RTFM:
THIS IS SOMETHING SMALL SO FAR WITH A BUNCH OF STUFF TO ADD.

There are multiple tools in here to screw with iPhones and iPads.
Nothing in here requires rooting or jailbreaking of devices.
Some of the stuff needs formatting and might need to be edited to work on your system.
THAT IS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Some of these contain exploits and whatnot so if your opsec officer tells you not to mess with this stuff, then don't.

Any questions, just shoot them to prawksie.trollsmith@gmail.com and ask for kasper

This will also include jacked api keys and other things that leaky applications spew.
